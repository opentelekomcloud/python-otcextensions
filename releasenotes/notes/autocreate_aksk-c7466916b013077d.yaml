    The autocreate AK/SK feature utilizes the capability of creating
    a temporary AK/SK to run commands that require a AK/SK without
    explicitly providing a AK/SK in the configuration. This feature can be
    activated by setting "autocreate_aksk" to true in the clouds.yaml.
    When activated a temporary AK/SK will be automatically created
    whenever it is needed.
