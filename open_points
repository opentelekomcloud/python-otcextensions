This document gathers issues, which are found during diggint the API and other OS tools working with API

* on 28.03 native service version discovery request to https://as.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/autoscaling-api/ caused timeout. AS service is temporarily disabled

# General:

* Inconsistent naming between services (AS:create_time, KMS:creation_date, CCE:createAt)
* Inconsistent error message structure between services (i.e. KMS vs RDS). This prohibits code generalization
* No custom service supports proper version discovery. Leads to error messages in the OSC tool and execution delays
* LB: while Neutron LBaaS is "strongly" considered as deprecated and no bindings are present in Ansible/OSC
  it will likely not be possible/challenge to upstream this support.
* EVS: volume type list --long returns changing results
* Subnet (in some APIs) is most likely net_id

# KMS:

* service version discovery is broken. On https://kms.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/ it returns
  {"versions": [{"status": "CURRENT", "id": "v1.0", "links": [{"href": "https://rts.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/v1/", "rel": "self"}]}]}
  In the keystoneauth1 it results to get_endpoint=https://kms.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/v1 (instead of V1.0). Detailed investigation is expensive, therefore aborted
* does not follow REST, everything is POST with different URLs and not even json['action']
* is conceptually far away from Barbican
* API Doc: This API allows you to create a plaintext-free DEK, that is, the returned result of this API includes `only the plaintext` of the DEK.
* purpose of KMS is not precise. Attributes change their names/meaning depending on call
* encryption_context is described to be string, in reality dict is expected
* max_length is always expected to be exactly max. Make no sense as a param
* list CMK filter by key_state not working as documented
* format of the timestamp is unknown
* no way to get response in English

# CCE

* required header application/type also for GET
* cluster UUID is hidden in a inline metadata structure, making it hard to address it without dirty hacks.
  Apis are jumping through this structure in anti-rest pattern
* attribute naming: metadata.uuid vs metadata.uid
* undocumented properties of the cluster.spec field (i.e. `cidr`)
* far away from Magnum
* Cluster has both VPC and VPC_ID, in GET VPC is name, in POST it should be ID
* Subnet is most likely net_id
* In AS sys disk has type "SYS", in CCE - "root"
* Node delete possible only by name, and not id

# DCS:

* DCS: in OS DCS is part of Trove. The API is same. In the DCS API is similar to RDS, but not easy mappable
* DCS: Since Redis 3.0.7 (only available in DCS) lots of critical issues (incl. security and possible data corruption), online memory defrag, less mem usage were fixed

# MRS:
* Inconsistent naming between services ( data_processing-mrs )

# OBS:

* OBS has storage class on Bucket level, but in AWS and all corresponding tools (also s3cmd, s4cmd, Boto) it is on the Object level

# DNS (Designate):

* nothing supports private zone (ansible, heat, ~terraform, SDK/CLI). Very hard to cover that everywhere
* Zone transfer, slave zone are not present. Modern Designateclient is not getting clear with response of designate
* API v2 is not implemented

# HEAT:

* very old level, blocking many OpenSource projects, including i.e. ansible-openshift, RedhatDNS.
* (to be doublechecked) template version check is likely not done, since features of later templates with older version header are passing validation (in the ranges of supported versions)
* validate return ok, doesn't mean create will pass (validation errors i.e. template version doesn't match, condition on a resource level was also added on newton)
* not all CLI calls return result
* Not possible to rely on mountpoint of the OS::Cinder::VolumeAttachment - it's ignored
* usage of Server with block_device_mapping_v2, devicename="sdX" and > 1 device fails. Port is not released leaving system in inconsistent state (if router interface is deleted can be cleaned only manually)
* OS::Neutron::LBaaS::HealthMonitor does not support type HTTPS, but GUI allows it
* update stack with existing template is missing

# Shade/Ansible:

* enabling SNAT through Ansible not possible, since upstream expects default as true and sends only false if set (shade:_build_external_gateway_info)
* only able to pass SYS volume size if boot_from_volume=True (default=false)
* on a play retry port in the subnet changes if exists (change IP) and corrupts connection
* Ansible: no support for load balancer
* Ansible (Heat): https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/30786 - small fix to see the failure message if stack create/update fails

# VPC:

* VPC uses network wrapped subnets. Simple net with multiple subnets is not properly visible in OTC (in VPCs list subnet count includes all subnets, but in VPC show subnets are missing)


# OpenStackSDK:

* LBaaS: pool.healthmonitor_id according to ref api (and in OTC), but in the SDK it is health_monitor_ids (list) (reported under https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2001872). Some other attributes missing
  - pool_member operating_status missing
* LBaaS HM: max_retries_down missing (optional and not present in OTC)


# DOC:
* at least on example of ULB LIST allows filtering, but it is not documented
