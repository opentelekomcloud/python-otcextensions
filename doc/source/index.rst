Welcome to the OTC Extensions of the OpenStack SDK and CLI!
===========================================================

Accessing the `OpenStack API`_ directly can be tedious. The `OpenStack
SDK`_ is a Python based client library that simplifies building
applications to work with OpenStack clouds. **This project, OTC
Extensions,** augments this SDK and adds extra functionality offered
by the `Open Telekom Cloud`_. The OTC Extensions serve two purposes:
Firstly, they provide Python classes and methods to attach your own
code to the cloud. For example, `Ansible modules`_ use this
way. Secondly, the OTC Extensions automatically extend the `OpenStack
Client`_, the CLI tool to manage the OpenStack cloud.

Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

The :doc:`installation <install/index>` guide explains system
administrators and developers how to setup the project from operation
system packages, from pip, directly from sources and other
installation forms. OTC Extensions are very easy to configure: All
credentials can be configured in one or two files.


Working with the CLI tool
-------------------------

Users who want to access Open Telekom Cloud specific services with
:doc:`command line tools <cli/index>` for a shell like Bash find
documentation of all of their operations and properties in this section.


Writing your own Scripts for the Cloud
--------------------------------------

Developers, who plan to write own Python code, may access the API more
easily by using the OTC Extensions' classes and methods. The
:doc:`SDK interfaces <sdk/index>` are documented in this
section.


Contribute to the Project
-------------------------

Developers, who want to :doc:`contribute <contributor/index>` to the
project, find helpful background information and architecture
specification of OTC Extensions here.


General Information
-------------------

Adding to that, there is some general background information
available:

* In a :doc:`glossary <appendices/glossary>` important terms and their naming conventions are
  described.

* There is a :doc:`history <appendices/history>` explaing the ancestry of this project. This
  may or may not be insightful if you want to understand the projects
  architecture.

* There is a :doc:`release history <appendices/releasenotes>` available.

* A list of :doc:`issues <appendices/issues>` is maintained.

* Currently 13 services are :doc:`covered <coverage>` by the OTC extensions.
