Getting started with the OTCExtensions SDK
==========================================

Please note that OTCExtensions provides an extension to the OpenStackSDK.
Please refer to it's documentation for the details <https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstacksdk/latest/>


Installation
------------

The OTCExtensions SDK is available on
`GitHub <https://github.com/OpenTelekomCloud/python-otcextensions.git>`_.
To install it, use ``pip``::

   $ pip install otcextensions

User Guides
-----------

These guides walk you through how to make use of the libraries we provide
to work with each OpenStack service. If you're looking for a cookbook
approach, this is where you'll want to begin.

API Documentation
-----------------

OpenStackSDK documentation is available under <https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstacksdk/latest/user/index.html#api-documentation>


Service APIs are exposed through a two-layered approach. The classes
exposed through our `Connection Interface`_ are
the place to start if you're an application developer consuming an OpenStack
cloud. The `Resource Interface`_ is the layer upon which the
`Connection Interface`_ is built, with methods on `Service Proxies`_ accepting
and returning :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource` objects.

The Cloud Abstraction layer has a data model.

Connection Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :class:`~openstack.connection.Connection` instance maintains your cloud
config, session and authentication information providing you with a set of
higher-level interfaces to work with OpenStack services.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   connection

Once you have a :class:`~openstack.connection.Connection` instance, services
are accessed through instances of :class:`~openstack.proxy.Proxy` or
subclasses of it that exist as attributes on the
:class:`~openstack.connection.Connection`.

.. autoclass:: openstack.proxy.Proxy

Service Proxies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following service proxies exist on the
:class:`~openstack.connection.Connection`. The service proxies are all always
present on the :class:`~openstack.connection.Connection` object, but the
combination of your ``CloudRegion`` and the catalog of the cloud in question
control which services can be used.

Resource Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Resource* layer is a lower-level interface to
communicate with OpenStack services. While the classes exposed by the
`Service Proxies`_ build a convenience layer on top of
this, :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource` objects can be
used directly. However, the most common usage of this layer is in receiving
an object from a class in the `Connection Interface_`, modifying it, and
sending it back to the `Service Proxies`_ layer, such as to update a resource
on the server.

The following services have exposed :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource`
classes.

Low-Level Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following classes are not commonly used by application developers,
but are used to construct applications to talk to OpenStack APIs. Typically
these parts are managed through the `Connection Interface`_, but their use
can be customized.
