Distributed Cache Service (DCS)
===============================

   :local:

Redis is a NoSQL database. It can handle various data structures, but should
not be used for complex data structures; relational databases are better
suited for these. While caching the storage in the RAM allows fast data
access, Redis is ideal for all applications in which speed is the main focus.
However, the storage cache not persistent, meaning that the stored data is
deleted if the virtual machine is switched off.
The Distributed Cache Service is ideal for use as a cache server (e.g. in
order to accelerate the loading times of websites), for real-time analyses,
high-speed transactions, and message queuing. Clusters made up of individual
DCS instances can be used for applications with extremely high performance
requirements. Redis is available in the Open Telekom Cloud as the Distributed
Cache Service. Via the console, the database can be defined in three variants:
as a single-node database for temporary data storage, as a master/standby
database for higher availability, and as a cluster for high performance.
The Distributed Cache Service is billed on an hourly basis in accordance with
the chosen RAM size and type (master/standby or single-node database).
