Cloud Trace Service (CTS)
=========================

Cloud Trace is an effective monitoring tool that allows users to analyze
their cloud resources using traces. A tracker is automatically generated when
the service is started. This tracker monitors access to all the respective
userâ€™s cloud resources by means of the traces generated. The monitoring logs
can be saved in the object storage cost-effectively and in the long term. The
Cloud Trace service can also be used in conjunction with Simple Message
Notification, with the user receiving a message when certain events occur.
Cloud Trace is free of charge.

CTS Tracker
-----------

A tracker will be automatically created after CTS is enabled. All traces
recorded by CTS are associated with the tracker. Only one
management tracker is currently created for each account in a region.
On the management console, you can query the last seven days of operation
records. To obtain more operation records, you can enable Object Storage
Service (OBS) and deliver operation records to OBS buckets for long-term
storage in real time.
