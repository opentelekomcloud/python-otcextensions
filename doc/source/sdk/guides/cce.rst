CCE Cluster
-----------

Cloud Container Engine (CCE) is a highly reliable and high-performance service
that allows enterprises to manage containerized applications. With support
for Kubernetes-native applications and tools, CCE makes it simple to set up
an environment for running containers in the cloud. CCE Clusters are the
environment where cluster nodes are administrated. The core component
is a Kubernetes Cluster with advanced features.

List CCE Clusters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to query all CCE clusters and to filter
the output with query parameters.

   :lines: 16-22

Create CCE Cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to create a CCE cluster instance with
parameters.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/create_cluster.py
   :lines: 16-53

Get CCE Cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to get a CCE cluster by ID
or an instance of class
:class:`~otcextensions.sdk.cce.v3.cluster.Cluster`.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/get_cluster.py
   :lines: 16-24

Find CCE Cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to find a CCE cluster by ID
or name.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/find_cluster.py
   :lines: 16-24

Delete CCE Cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to get a CCE cluster by ID
or an instance of class
:class:`~otcextensions.sdk.cce.v3.cluster.Cluster`.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/delete_cluster.py
   :lines: 16-25

CCE Node
--------

A CCE cluster node is the computing instance of a CCE cluster where
containers are hosted. One cluster can manage several nodes which
can be distributed over different availability zones to increase
reliability.

List CCE Cluster Nodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to query all nodes of a CCE cluster
and to filter the output with query parameters.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/list_cluster_nodes.py
   :lines: 16-25

Create CCE Cluster Node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to create a CCE cluster node instance with
parameters.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/create_cluster_node.py
   :lines: 16-53

Get CCE Cluster Node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to get a CCE cluster by ID
or an instance of class
:class:`~otcextensions.sdk.cce.v3.cluster_node.ClusterNode`.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/get_cluster_node.py
   :lines: 16-26

Find CCE Cluster Node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to find a node of a CCE cluster by ID
or name.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/find_cluster_node.py
   :lines: 16-24

Delete CCE Cluster Node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to delete a CCE cluster node by ID
or an instance of class
:class:`~otcextensions.sdk.cce.v3.cluster_node.ClusterNode`.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/delete_cluster_node.py
   :lines: 16-25

CCE Node Pool
-------------

A node pool is a group of one or more nodes with identical configuration
in a cluster. In CCE, the nodes configured during cluster creation are
grouped into the default node pool. The default node pool is named
DefaultPool and cannot be edited, deleted, or migrated. In CCE SDK,
you can create custom node pools in a cluster to organize cluster nodes
into different pools so that you can edit or delete a node pool
individually without affecting the entire cluster. All nodes in a custom
node pool have identical parameters and node type. You cannot configure
a single node in a node pool; any configuration changes affect all nodes
in the node pool.

List CCE Node Pools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to query all node pools of a CCE cluster
and to filter the output with query parameters.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/list_node_pools.py
   :lines: 16-25

Create CCE Node Pool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to create a CCE node pool instance with
parameters.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/create_node_pool.py
   :lines: 16-99

Get CCE Node Pool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to get a CCE node pool by ID
or an instance of class
:class:`~otcextensions.sdk.cce.v3.node_pool.NodePool`.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/get_node_pool.py
   :lines: 16-26

Find CCE Node Pool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to find a node pool of a CCE cluster by ID
or name.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/find_node_pool.py
   :lines: 16-26

Delete CCE Node Pool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to delete a CCE node pool by ID
or an instance of class
:class:`~otcextensions.sdk.cce.v3.node_pool.NodePool`.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/delete_node_pool.py
   :lines: 16-26

Job Operations
--------------

Jobs are created while cluster creation and other similar operations
have been started. Jobs have different phases and can be triggered by
the following methods.

Get Job
^^^^^^^

This interface is used to get a CCE Job by ID
or an instance of class
:class:`~otcextensions.sdk.cce.v3.job.Job`.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/get_job.py
   :lines: 16-24

Wait for a Job
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This interface is used to wait for a CCE Job until reaches a specific state
by using ID or an instance of class
:class:`~otcextensions.sdk.cce.v3.job.Job`.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/cce/wait_for_job.py
   :lines: 16-24
