Every resource which is used within the proxy methods have own attributes.
Those attributes define the behavior of the resource which can be a cluster
or a node or anything different logical unit in an OpenStack Cloud. The
*Resource* layer is a lower-level interface to communicate with OpenStack
services. While the classes exposed by the :ref:`service-proxies` build a
convenience layer on top of this, :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource`
objects can be used directly. However, the most common usage of this layer is
in receiving an object from a class in the `Connection Interface_`,
modifying it, and sending it back to the :ref:`service-proxies` layer,
such as to update a resource on the server.

The following services have exposed :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource`
classes.
