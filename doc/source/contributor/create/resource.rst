Creating a New Resource
=======================

This guide will walk you through how to add resources for a service.

Naming Conventions
------------------

Above all, names across this project conform to Python's naming standards,
as laid out in `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.

The relevant details we need to know are as follows:

   * Module names are lower case, and separated by underscores if more than
     one word. For example, ``openstack.object_store``
   * Class names are capitalized, with no spacing, and each subsequent word is
     capitalized in a name. For example, ``ServerMetadata``.
   * Attributes on classes, including methods, are lower case and separated
     by underscores. For example, ``allow_list`` or ``get_data``.

Services
********

Services in the OpenStack SDK are named after their program name, not their
code name. For example, the project often known as "Nova" is always called
"compute" within this SDK.

This guide walks through creating service for an OpenStack program called
"Fake". Following our guidelines, the code for its service would
live under the ``openstack.fake`` namespace. What follows is the creation
of a :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource` class for the "Fake" service.

Resources
*********

Resources are named after the server-side resource, which is set in the
``base_path`` attribute of the resource class. This guide creates a
resource class for the ``/fake`` server resource, so the resource module
is called ``fake.py`` and the class is called ``Fake``.

An Example
----------

``openstack/fake/fake_service.py``

.. literalinclude:: examples/resource/fake_service.py
   :language: Python
   :linenos:

``openstack/fake/v2/fake.py``

.. literalinclude:: examples/resource/fake.py
   :language: Python
   :linenos:

``fake.Fake`` Attributes
------------------------

Each service's resources inherit from :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource`,
so they can override any of the base attributes to fit the way their
particular resource operates.

``resource_key`` and ``resources_key``
**************************************

These attributes are set based on how your resource responds with data.
The default values for each of these are ``None``, which works fine
when your resource returns a JSON body that can be used directly without a
top-level key, such as ``{"name": "Ernie Banks", ...}"``.

However, our ``Fake`` resource returns JSON bodies that have the details of
the resource one level deeper, such as
``{"resources": {"name": "Ernie Banks", ...}, {...}}``. It does a similar
thing with single resources, putting them inside a dictionary keyed on
``"resource"``.

By setting ``Fake.resource_key`` on *line 8*, we tell the ``Resource.create``,
``Resource.get``, and ``Resource.update`` methods that we're either sending
or receiving a resource that is in a dictionary with that key.

By setting ``Fake.resources_key`` on *line 9*, we tell the ``Resource.list``
method that we're expecting to receive multiple resources inside a dictionary
with that key.

``base_path``
*************

The ``base_path`` is the URL we're going to use to make requests for this
resource. In this case, *line 10* sets ``base_path = "/fake"``, which also
corresponds to the name of our class, ``Fake``.

Most resources follow this basic formula. Some cases are more complex, where
the URL to make requests to has to contain some extra data. The volume service
has several resources which make either basic requests or detailed requests,
so they use ``base_path = "/volumes/%s(detailed)"``. Before a request is made,
if ``detailed = True``, they convert it to a string so the URL becomes
``/volumes/detailed``. If it's ``False``, they only send ``/volumes/``.

``service``
***********

*Line 11* is an instance of the service we're implementing. Each resource
ties itself to the service through this setting, so that the proper URL
can be constructed.

In ``fake_service.py``, we specify the valid versions as well as what this
service is called in the service catalog. When a request is made for this
resource, the Session now knows how to construct the appropriate URL using
this ``FakeService`` instance.

Supported Operations
--------------------

The base :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource` disallows all types of requests
by default, requiring each resource to specify which requests they support.
On *lines 14-19*, our ``Fake`` resource specifies that it'll work with all
of the operations.

In order to have the following methods work, you must allow the corresponding
value by setting it to ``True``:

+----------------------------------------------+----------------+
| :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource.create` | allow_create   |
+----------------------------------------------+----------------+
| :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource.delete` | allow_delete   |
+----------------------------------------------+----------------+
| :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource.head`   | allow_head     |
+----------------------------------------------+----------------+
| :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource.list`   | allow_list     |
+----------------------------------------------+----------------+
| :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource.fetch`  | allow_fetch    |
+----------------------------------------------+----------------+
| :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource.commit` | allow_commit   |
+----------------------------------------------+----------------+

An additional attribute to set is ``commit_method``. It defaults to ``PUT``,
but some services use ``POST`` or ``PATCH`` to commit changes back to the
remote resource.

Properties
----------

.. TODO(shade) Especially this section

The way resource classes communicate values between the user and the server
are :class:`~openstack.resource.prop` objects. These act similarly to Python's
built-in property objects, but they share only the name - they're not the same.

Properties are set based on the contents of a response body or headers.
Based on what your resource returns, you should set ``prop``\s to map
those those values to ones on your :class:`~openstack.resource.Resource`
object.

*Line 22* sets a prop for ``timestamp`` , which will cause the
``Fake.timestamp`` attribute to contain the value returned in an
``X-Timestamp`` header, such as from a ``Fake.head`` request.

*Line 24* sets a prop for ``name``, which is a value returned in a body, such
as from a ``Fake.get`` request. Note from *line 12* that ``name`` is
specified its ``id`` attribute, so when this resource
is populated from a response, ``Fake.name`` and ``Fake.id`` are the same
value.

*Line 26* sets a prop which contains an alias. ``Fake.value`` will be set
when a response body contains a ``value``, or when a header contains
``X-Resource-Value``.

*Line 28* specifies a type to be checked before sending the value in a request.
In this case, we can only set ``Fake.cool`` to either ``True`` or ``False``,
otherwise a TypeError will be raised if the value can't be converted to the
expected type.

Documentation
-------------

We use Sphinx's ``autodoc`` feature in order to build API documentation for
each resource we expose. The attributes we override from
:class:`~openstack.resource.Resource` don't need to be documented, but any
:class:`~openstack.resource.prop` attributes must be. All you need to do is
add a comment *above* the line to document, with a colon following the
pound-sign.

*Lines 21, 23, 25, and 27-28* are comments which will then appear in the API
documentation. As shown in *lines 27 & 28*, these comments can span multiple
lines.
