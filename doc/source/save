Accessing the `OpenStack API`_ can be tedious. The `OpenStack SDK`_ is
a Python based programming library that simplifies using that API.
This project, OTC Extensions, augments this SDK and adds extra
functionality offered by the `Open Telekom Cloud`_. The OTC Extensions
serve two purposes: Firstly, they provide Python classes and methods
to attach your own code to the cloud. For example, `Ansible modules`_
use this way. Secondly, the OTC Extensions automatically extend the
`OpenStack Client`_, the CLI tool to manage the OpenStack cloud.

This documentation is split into four sections, adressing several use
cases:

* The :doc:`installation <install/index>` guide explains system
  administrators and developers how to setup the project from
  operation system packages, from pip, directly from sources and other
  installation forms. **** Configuration ****

* Users who want to access Open Telekom Cloud specific services with
  :doc:`command line tools <cli/index>` find documentation of all of
  their opetions and properties in this section.

* Developers, who plan to write own Python code, may access the API
  more easily by using the OTC Extensions' classes and methods. The
  :doc:`architecture and interfaces <user/index>` are documented in
  this section.
  
* Developers, who want to :doc:`contribute <contributor/index>` to the
  project find helpful background information.
